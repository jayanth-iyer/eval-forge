# Tricky Questions

## Question 1
**Question:** A man lives on the 20th floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the ground floor. When he comes home, he takes the elevator to the 10th floor and walks the rest of the way... except on rainy days, when he takes the elevator all the way to the 20th floor. Why?
**Answer:** The man is too short to reach the button for the 20th floor, except when he has an umbrella on rainy days.

## Question 2
**Question:** If you have a 3-gallon jug and a 5-gallon jug, how do you measure exactly 4 gallons?
**Answer:** Fill the 5-gallon jug, pour into 3-gallon jug (leaving 2 gallons in 5-gallon jug). Empty 3-gallon jug, pour the 2 gallons into it. Fill 5-gallon jug again, pour into 3-gallon jug until full (1 gallon fits), leaving exactly 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.

## Question 3
**Question:** What comes next in this sequence: O, T, T, F, F, S, S, E, ?
**Answer:** N (Nine). The sequence represents the first letter of numbers: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine.

## Question 4
**Question:** A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
**Answer:** $0.05 (5 cents). If the ball costs x, then the bat costs x + $1.00, so x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10, which means 2x = $0.10, so x = $0.05.

## Question 5
**Question:** You are in a room with three light switches. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs in another room. You can only visit the other room once. How do you determine which switch controls which bulb?
**Answer:** Turn on the first switch for a few minutes, then turn it off. Turn on the second switch and leave it on. Go to the other room: the bulb that's on is controlled by the second switch, the bulb that's off but warm is controlled by the first switch, and the bulb that's off and cool is controlled by the third switch.

## Question 6
**Question:** If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
**Answer:** 5 minutes. Each machine makes 1 widget in 5 minutes, so 100 machines make 100 widgets in 5 minutes.

## Question 7
**Question:** A lily pad doubles in size every day. If it takes 48 days for the lily pad to cover the entire pond, on what day was the pond half covered?
**Answer:** Day 47. Since the lily pad doubles in size each day, it was half the final size the day before it covered the entire pond.

## Question 8
**Question:** You have 12 balls that look identical. 11 of them weigh the same, but one is either heavier or lighter. Using a balance scale only 3 times, how do you find the different ball?
**Answer:** Divide into groups of 4. Weigh two groups: if balanced, the different ball is in the third group; if unbalanced, it's in the heavier/lighter group. Then use similar logic to narrow down within the group of 4 in the remaining weighings.

## Question 9
**Question:** What is the next number in this sequence: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ?
**Answer:** 312211. This is the "look-and-say" sequence where each term describes the previous term: 1 (one 1), 11 (two 1s), 21 (one 2, one 1), 1211 (one 1, one 2, two 1s), 111221 (three 1s, two 2s, one 1), 312211.

## Question 10
**Question:** A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many sheep are left?
**Answer:** 9 sheep. "All but 9" means all except 9, so 9 sheep remain alive.

## Question 11
**Question:** If you're running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?
**Answer:** Second place. You've taken their position, not first place.

## Question 12
**Question:** A man pushes his car to a hotel and tells the owner he's bankrupt. What happened?
**Answer:** He's playing Monopoly. He landed on a property with a hotel and doesn't have enough money to pay the rent.

## Question 13
**Question:** What weighs more: a pound of feathers or a pound of gold?
**Answer:** They weigh the same (both are one pound), but this is a trick question because gold is typically measured in troy pounds (12 oz) while feathers use avoirdupois pounds (16 oz), so a pound of feathers would actually weigh more.

## Question 14
**Question:** A woman lives in a skyscraper. She can take the elevator to the lobby, but she can only take it to the 7th floor when going up, then must walk the rest of the way to the 20th floor. However, if someone else is in the elevator or if it's raining, she can take it all the way up. Why?
**Answer:** She's too short to reach the button for the 20th floor, except when someone else can press it or when she has an umbrella on rainy days.

## Question 15
**Question:** You have two ropes. Each rope takes exactly 60 minutes to burn completely. The ropes burn unevenly (some parts burn faster than others). How do you measure exactly 45 minutes using these ropes?
**Answer:** Light rope 1 at both ends and rope 2 at one end simultaneously. When rope 1 burns out (30 minutes), light the other end of rope 2. When rope 2 burns out completely, exactly 45 minutes will have passed (30 + 15 minutes).
